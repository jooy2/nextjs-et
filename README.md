## Installation
Clone this repo using below command.
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/jooy2/nextjs-et <PROJECT_NAME>
```

Then, install the dependency module.
```shell
$ npm i
```

## Testing in development & production
You can test your project in the development environment using the following command:
```shell
$ npm run dev
```

To build into a production environment, first build the Next.js page by entering the following command:
```shell
$ npm run client:build
```

If a folder called `.next` is created at the top of the project, you can test the production environment with the following command.
```shell
$ npm run start
```

## Database Configurations
When the Next.js custom server starts, the database is initialized with the connection information. Default schema files can be defined in `server/models`.

- See Sequelize's documentation for details: https://sequelize.org/master/index.html

A `.db-connection.json` file must be created in the root path to read connection information.

The contents of this file are written by referring to the `.db-connection.json.example` file in the root path.

Note that different `development` and `production` environments use different connection information.
```text
...
"development": {
  "username": "user",
  "password": "pass",
  "database": "mydb",
  "host": "example.com",
  "port": 3306,
  "timezone": "+09:00",
  "dialectOptions": {
    "decimalNumbers": true
  },
  "dialect": "mariadb",
  "operatorsAliases": 0
},
...
```

### How to disable database connection?
Remove the `models.sequelize.sync()` call part at the bottom of the `server/index.js` file, and move the `server.listen(port);` code outside.
```javascript
// before
models.sequelize.sync(syncOptions).then(() => { // <-- Remove this line
  server.listen(port);
  console.info(`client-server is running on port ${port}!!!`);
}); // <-- Remove this line

// after
server.listen(port);
console.info(`client-server is running on port ${port}!!!`);
```
